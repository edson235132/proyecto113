		<h3>FIFA 22 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts. It is the 29th installment in the FIFA series, and was released worldwide on 1 October 2021 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.[1] Players who pre-ordered the ultimate edition, however, received four days of early access and were able to play the game from 27 September.

Kylian Mbapp√© is the cover athlete for the second consecutive year.[2]

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, EA removed Russian national teams from all versions (since 1.22 patch) of its football video games, and made Russian and Belarusian players ineligible for FIFA 22.
